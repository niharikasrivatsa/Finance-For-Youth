  <p>
    Bonds are investment securities where an investor lends money to a company or a government for a set period of time, in exchange for regular interest payments. Once the bond reaches maturity, the bond issuer returns the investorâ€™s money. Fixed income is a term often used to describe bonds, since your investment earns fixed payments over the life of the bond.
    Corporations and governments finance bonds to fund their operations.
